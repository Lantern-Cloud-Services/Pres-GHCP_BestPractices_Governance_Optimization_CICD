# GitHub Copilot Best Practices, Governance, Optimization, and CI/CD

This repository contains an interactive HTML presentation focused on practical adoption patterns for GitHub Copilot in enterprise engineering workflows.

## Overview

This presentation is aimed at engineering teams and technical leads who are actively using or evaluating GitHub Copilot. It covers the full spectrum of responsible, high-quality AI-assisted development — from safely introducing Copilot into legacy codebases, through governance and prompt engineering, to automated testing and CI/CD integration.

The session moves through five topic areas:

- **Legacy and brownfield safety** — How to build the context that Copilot needs to work well in complex existing systems, and patterns for incrementally expanding its use without introducing risk.
- **Guardrails and governance** — Practical controls around what goes into prompts, which tools are trusted, and how organizations can enforce policy consistently across teams.
- **Prompting and context engineering** — A shift from ad-hoc prompting to structured context, token-efficient workflows, and the Research → Plan → Implement pattern for agentic tasks.
- **Testing and validation** — Using Copilot to generate tests, run validation agents at key pipeline stages, and establish deterministic quality gates that complement AI's probabilistic nature.
- **GitHub Actions and CI/CD** — Generating and maintaining reusable YAML workflows, accelerating onboarding for new teams, and migrating pipelines from other platforms.

The presentation closes with a brief walkthrough of how the deck itself was produced using GitHub Copilot, serving as a live demonstration of the principles discussed.
